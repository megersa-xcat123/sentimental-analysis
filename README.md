Testing this data using different machine learning (LogisticRegression, NaiveBayes) Also we designed model using deep Algorithm

Accepting amharic text from the designed interface and predict the sentiment of the text (ongoing project, UI designed using Flask). In this project we designed model that analysis social media posts and other fake news that distributed on different channels that written in Amharic language. To do so, we collect dataset from different sources like:
 * Social media (Facebook, Twitter)
 * Broadcast media
 * And other data sources 
 
 The main purpose of this project is to monitoring the fake news broadcasting on the public media and minimizes the wrong information that increase the gap between the peoples relations.
